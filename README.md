# YACS [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jeffh/YACS.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jeffh/YACS)
Simple, Sane Course Scheduling.

YACS is a web-based course schedule with an emphasis on usability.
It is also flexible enough to work with other school course data.

## Setup
YACS is actively developed on [Python][] 2.7. So go get that installed first.
It's good python practice to put this project inside a [virtualenv][],
but that's beyond the scope of this README.

You can download an archive from the top-right of the github page or clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/jeffh/YACS

Which will download code into a YACS folder where you run this command.

[virtualenv]: http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html

### Dependencies

YACS is built on top of [Django][] 1.7. Thus, it requires a database driver to run.
Install the appropriate driver and its database, or just use the bundled SQLite.

[Django]: https://www.djangoproject.com/ "Django Web Framework"

### Setup (Development)

1. YACS uses a lot of dependencies. It relies on [pip][] to install most of them. Simply do:
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   Which will install most of dependencies YACS needs for postgres. Depending on your
   operating system, you'll probably need to install some system libraries for
   `libmemcached`, `zlib`, `libsasl`, `psyocopg2`.


2. Edit `DATABASES` variable in the `yacs/settings/development.py` file to your
   appropriate database settings.

3. Run the following commands. When calling syncdb, you'll be ask to create a superuser,
   it is purely optional, only the debug-toolbar is visible for logged in super-users.

    ```
    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

4. Next we need to get some data. Run these commands to import and setup the data for use.
   (These will take awhile).

    ```
    python manage.py import_course_data   # imports from RPI SIS + PDFs
    python manage.py import_catalog_data  # imports from RPI course catalog
    python manage.py create_section_cache # creates cache for generating schedules
    ```

    It is ok for these commands to emit parse errors.

5. Check it out by running the dev server `python manage.py runserver` and pointing your
   browser to [http://localhost:8000/][local] and viola!

6. By default, YACS will hide the course data for manual review. Go to the [django admin][]
   and make the semesters visible to see them in your user interface.

[local]: http://localhost:8000/
[django admin]: http://localhost:8000/admin/

## Setup (Production)

It's probably best to use the associated project: [seafood][]. Which is a [salt][]
configuration project that can be used to set up a server for YACS.

The following environmental variables are used in production:

- **YACS_ENV**: The environment to use. The default is ``development``, but this should be
                set to ``production`` for production settings to take effect.
- **YACS_DATABASE_URL**: The database url to connect. Parsed using dj_database_url.
                         In the form of dbengine://user:pass@host/dbname
- **YACS_SECRET_KEY**: The internal django secret key to use. Be unique!

When using [seafood][], you'll need to modify the salt configuration files to be
unique for your installation. YACS uses email for notifying ADMINS in project settings.

After using [seafood][] to set up the environment, use:

    ```
    fab -H root@my-server deploy
    ```

To deploy YACS to the server. Updates can be deployed to the server in the same fashion.

## Project layout
Currently the project is laid out as follows:

- **api**: API application. Where all  API related code is. Relies on courses and scheduler app.
- **courses**: The courses application. Contains the schema and manages the storage of course data. Also contains course-data-displaying views.
- **courses_viz**: An application that stores visualization of course data. (Part of Introduction to Visualization class)
- **jslog**: An application that can record basic JS data for debugging.
- **lib**: Contains library code that can, be potentially, separated into an independent project. To enforce this separability, this folder is added to the sys.path for absolute imports
- **scheduler**: This app handles course scheduling. Relies on the courses app for all the course data.
- **yacs**: Project files. Contains settings, root urls, templates, static files, etc.
- **test_reports**: Only appears when tests are executed. Used to see the test coverage.
- **requirements**: Contains various requirement files for PIP.
- **Makefile**: Used for running tests, cleaning python caches and deployment.
- **manage.py**: Django's CLI.

## Help
There are still issues to tackle. Go to the [GitHub issues][issues] page to see them all.

This project is now being worked on as a RCOS project.
